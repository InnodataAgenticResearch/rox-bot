# Engineering standards for agentic engineers

These apply to every repo you (human or agent) write or change. They are loaded into
every Hermes session. Source of truth: `STANDARDS.md` in github.com/InnodataIsraelResearchTeam/makor.

## 1. Tests: near-100% deterministic coverage

- **Coverage gate:** 100% line and branch coverage, enforced by the test runner so the build fails
  below it. Exclusions are allowed only line-by-line, each with a reason comment
  (e.g. `# pragma: no cover - platform-specific`). Never lower the threshold to get a green build.
- **Deterministic means** the same code and inputs give the same result every run, on any machine:
  - No real network, wall clock, sleeps, or unseeded randomness in tests. Inject clocks, seeds,
    HTTP clients and filesystems; use fakes or recorded fixtures.
  - No dependence on test order, timezone, locale, CPU count, or leftover files. Use temp dirs.
  - Run the suite in random order and twice in a row; both runs must pass and produce the same coverage.
- **Only deterministic tests count.** A flaky test is a bug: fix it or quarantine it with a
  tracked issue. Coverage from quarantined tests does not count.
- Every bug fix lands with a test that failed before the fix.

## 2. Linters are essential

- Every repo has a formatter, a linter, and (where the language has one) a strict type checker,
  pinned through Nix. Zero warnings, not just zero errors.
- No inline disables without a reason comment on the same line. No repo-wide rule disables
  without a note in the repo's docs.
- Defaults by language:

  | Language | Format | Lint | Types | Tests + coverage |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Python | `ruff format` | `ruff check` | `mypy --strict` or `pyright` strict | `pytest -p randomly --cov --cov-branch --cov-fail-under=100` |
  | TypeScript / JS | `prettier` | `eslint` | `tsc --strict` | `vitest --coverage` with 100% thresholds |
  | Go | `gofmt` | `golangci-lint` (incl. `go vet`, `staticcheck`) | compiler | `go test -race -shuffle=on -cover` |
  | Shell | `shfmt` | `shellcheck` | | `bats` |
  | Nix | `nixfmt` | `statix`, `deadnix` | | `nix flake check` |
  | Markdown / YAML | `prettier` | `markdownlint`, `yamllint` | | |

## 3. One command proves it

- Every repo has a `justfile` with `just check`, which runs, in order: format check, lint,
  type check, tests with the coverage gate, and the docs build. It must pass with no network
  beyond fetching pinned dependencies.
- Tools come from the repo's `flake.nix` dev shell (`nix develop`), not from global installs.
- Linters and repo-specific policy rules run through [shac](https://github.com/shac-project/shac)
  (`shac.star`), so `shac check` lints just the changed files and `shac fmt` fixes formatting.
- When a failure pattern should never happen again, encode it as a shac check with a test.
- Before saying work is done, run `just check` and report the real result. If it fails, say so
  and show the failure. Never claim "tests pass" without running them.

## 4. Documentation is a Docusaurus site with a documented server

- All project documentation lives in a Docusaurus site in `docs/` (Docusaurus 3, Markdown/MDX).
  The repo's `README.md` stays short and links into it.
- The docs build is strict: `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'` and `onBrokenMarkdownLinks: 'throw'`.
  `just check` runs the build.
- Every repo ships an HTTP server for its docs, and documents it on a docs page
  ("Running the docs server"):
  - `just docs-dev`: live-reload server, `docusaurus start --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3000`.
  - `just docs-serve`: builds the site (hermetically, via Nix where possible), then serves the static output on 127.0.0.1:3000.
  - The page states the command, host, port, how to reach it from a laptop
    (`gcloud compute ssh <vm> -- -L 3000:localhost:3000`, then open <http://localhost:3000>),
    and how to stop it.
- Bind to `127.0.0.1` by default. Exposing docs on a public interface or opening firewall
  ports needs a human decision.
- Node comes from the Nix dev shell. Commit `package-lock.json`. Watch disk: a Docusaurus
  `node_modules` is several hundred MB.

## 5. Working rules for agents

- Write or update tests in the same change as the code. Code without tests is unfinished.
- Do not weaken a gate (coverage threshold, lint rule, type strictness, broken-link check) to
  make a change pass. If a gate seems wrong, stop and ask.
- Do not paper over memory leaks or OOM crashes by inflating runtime heap limits (e.g.
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=...`). Fix the underlying memory retention or streaming
  bottleneck in code and verify with a test.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits. Each commit passes `just check`.
- Record anything surprising (tool bugs, flaky behavior, environment issues) with an issue.
- Never put secrets in code, tests, fixtures, or docs.
